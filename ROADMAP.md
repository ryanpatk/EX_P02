# memex — North-star roadmap

**Status:** Written 2026-10-24, revised the same day after reviewing pond (raphaelsalaja/pond). This is the big picture that every build task should serve. Where this doc and `VISION.md` disagree, this doc wins. Update both deliberately. Domain words are defined in `CONTEXT.md`.

## 1. What memex is for

memex is the place for all of one person's scattered thoughts, creative inspiration and browsing interests: a digital extension of their mind. It closes one loop:

```
   total capture  ──►  visual display  ──►  high-level analysis
   (journal, extension,   (Journal, space boards,   (Claude and other agents
    share sheet, re-sync)   Library)                  over MCP or the files)
          ▲                                                   │
          └─────────────── insights become jots ◄─────────────┘
```

**The ownership rule:** memex the app can be thrown away at any time. Everything it ever knew lives in plain files you can back up, read without memex, and take with you (§3.4).

## 2. Requirements

1. **The Journal is home.** The root view is a chat-style feed where you dump everything: jots, links, notes, tasks, and things saved automatically. Everything is filed into spaces in the background. Spaces are working boards. The **Library** (today's stream grid) is the second view: a visual database of everything ever captured.
2. **Files you own, working like a remote database.** All data lives as plain files (markdown + frontmatter, JSON for structured settings, original images) that belong to you. They sync across phone, desktop and browser like a database does. Supabase goes away.
3. **Walk away any time.** Nothing exists only inside memex: not preview images, not space layouts, not filing rules. One folder is the whole product state.
4. **A native mobile app.** React Native (Expo), journal-first, with share-sheet capture.
5. **Rich automatic capture.** The browser extension saves X bookmarks, Pinterest saves and YouTube likes the moment you make them. v0.2 already does X + Pinterest.
6. **A desktop app (Tauri) with a re-sync safety net.** Periodically walks your saved lists on X, Pinterest and YouTube and captures anything the extension missed (pond-style). It also holds the local mirror of your files and a global capture shortcut.
7. **Agent access.** Claude and other agents can search, read and analyze everything through an MCP server, or by reading the files directly.

```

### 3.1 Shared core, separate UI layers

There isn't a magic bridge between React DOM and React Native. What's practical is one shared TypeScript package for everything that isn't pixels, plus separate UI layers.

- **Shared (`packages/core`):** data types, the entry/item model, composer parsing (`@space`, `#tag`, URL and task detection), filtering and search (`utils/streamItems.ts`), the `Repository` interface, React Query hooks, Zustand stores, the source registry, design tokens as TS constants.
- **Web stays Vite + React DOM.** The Pastel Sky CSS, masonry, frosted surfaces and CodeMirror editor are DOM-native craft.
- **Desktop reuses the web UI** inside Tauri, so it costs almost nothing beyond the native parts (re-sync, mirror, shortcut, tray).
- **Mobile is new Expo UI** on the same core. Expo DOM components (`'use dom'`) keep the CodeMirror editor instead of rewriting it.

### 3.2 Storage: the vault is the truth, one writer applies changes

Learned from two sources. Logseq moved off markdown files because several devices writing the same files caused conflicts and data loss. pond keeps files as the truth and works well, because **only one program ever writes them**. memex does the same, with the writer in the cloud so the phone and browser can reach it:

- **The vault is the source of truth.** An R2 bucket in your Cloudflare account holds plain files (§3.3).
- **One writer.** A Durable Object per vault applies every change in order. Multi-file changes are journaled (write a journal, apply, record a commit marker; on restart, finish or roll back), so a crash never leaves half a change. This is pond's executor.
- **Devices never write files.** Every client (web, desktop, phone, extension) keeps a local SQLite replica and an outbox of pending changes (`item.update {field, value}`, `entry.create`, `item.file {space}`…). It pushes the outbox to the writer and pulls the **change feed** since its last cursor (pond's `sync_actions`, across the network). The Journal opens instantly and works offline.
- **Conflicts are resolved by the writer, per field**, last write wins. Note bodies edited on two offline devices keep a conflict copy rather than merging (CRDT text merge only if that ever hurts).
- **The index can always be rebuilt.** The writer's SQLite (full-text search, counts, filters) is derived from the vault. “Reset index” rebuilds it from files, and a test does exactly that.
- **Auth:** single-user device pairing. Passkey sign-in on the web; pair the desktop app, phone and extension with a device token (QR code or paste). Generalizes today's `api_tokens`.
- **Sync engine:** with one writer, a small custom protocol (outbox push, cursor pull) is likely simpler than adopting LiveStore. The 4a spike confirms which one.

### 3.3 Vault format (draft)

Every file carries a schema version. IDs live inside files, so filenames are cosmetic and renames never break references. Tags and space membership are stored on the item (as pond stores `folderIds` in `info.json`), so there are no join tables. Readers are forgiving: unknown or broken fields fall back to defaults instead of failing.

```

  vault.json                        vault id, schema version, created

```

The full spec becomes `docs/vault-format.md` in Phase 2, with sample vaults frozen as test fixtures (pond's compatibility-fixture practice).

### 3.4 The walk-away guarantee

What “I can scrap memex any time” means in practice:

- **Complete.** Everything a user made or chose lives in the vault: items, jots, spaces with colours and board layouts, tags, saved views, filing rules, the raw capture of every save, and the images themselves.
- **Readable without memex.** Markdown + YAML frontmatter for content, small JSON files for structured settings, original image files. The mirror folder opens in Obsidian or any editor; a script can parse it in minutes.
- **Documented and versioned.** `docs/vault-format.md`, a `schema` field in every file, and fixtures that freeze what older vaults look like.
- **Backed up three ways.** R2 object versioning (or a nightly snapshot to a second bucket), the desktop mirror in `~/memex` (which Time Machine already covers), and optionally a nightly git commit in the mirror for full history.
- **Proven, not promised.** CI rebuilds the index from a fixture vault and compares the result. Once a quarter, do a walk-away drill: open the mirror in Obsidian and check nothing is missing.
- **True before the backend move too.** A Phase 2 export script writes today's Supabase data in the vault format, so the guarantee holds from early on. The same script becomes the Phase 4 migration.

### 3.5 Desktop app (Tauri)

A thin Tauri shell around the web UI, plus three native jobs:

1. **Mirror.** Keeps `~/memex` identical to the vault (pull the change feed, write files). Later: watch the folder so edits made in Obsidian come back as changes.
2. **Re-sync safety net.** On a schedule (default every 6 hours, jittered, only when online; plus “Check now”), walk your saved lists and send anything new through `POST /api/capture` with `capturedBy: resync`. The server dedupes on `(source, sourceId)`, so the extension and re-sync can overlap freely. Borrowed from pond's sync design:
   - **Watermark + early stop.** Remember the newest id seen per account and list; stop walking after a streak of already-known ids, so a run with nothing new costs one page. A weekly full walk catches anything older that was moved.
   - **Rate governor.** Per-source spacing with human jitter, a rolling budget, back off on 429 and `retry-after`, cooldowns persisted across restarts, and a hard stop on any login challenge or captcha (“X needs you to sign in again”).
   - **Scope per account.** Which lists to walk: X bookmarks (likes off by default), Pinterest saves (optionally specific boards), YouTube likes.
   - **Collections → spaces.** A Pinterest board can map to a space, so saves are filed with no AI and no effort.
   - **Visible.** A status line (“Last checked 2h ago · found 3 the extension missed”) and a small history so you can see the safety net working.
   - **How it reads the sites:** Tauri uses the system webview (WKWebView on macOS, WebView2 on Windows), with its own cookie store separate from Chrome. Tauri 2.4+ can *read* webview cookies, but setting them isn't confirmed shipped, so you **sign in once per site in a memex window** and the session persists. Hidden webviews then load each list page and run a small injected script that calls the site's own list API from inside the page (same origin, your cookies) or scrolls the page, and hands JSON back to Rust. pond's list harvesters (MIT) are the reference for each site. The IPC permission for those remote pages is limited to a single “here are results” command.
3. **Global capture shortcut + tray.** Jot from anywhere on the desktop without opening the window.

### 3.6 Agent access (MCP)

Two ways in, cheapest first:

- **Files (zero code).** Point Claude Code or any agent at the `~/memex` mirror. Markdown + frontmatter are easy for agents to grep, read and analyze, and images are local files they can open. Works from the day the Phase 2 export exists.
- **Remote MCP server on the Worker (`/mcp`).** Works from anywhere: claude.ai and Claude Desktop (custom connector, OAuth), Claude Code (bearer token), other MCP clients. It runs on the same index and vault, with no new storage.
  - **Read tools:** `search` (full text + filters: type, source, space, tag, date range), `get_item`, `get_journal` (date range), `list_spaces`, `space_overview`, `timeline_stats` (counts by day, source, space), `get_images` (thumbnails from R2 as image content, so Claude can *look* at your inspiration).
  - **Semantic tools (v2):** `similar`, `clusters`, `themes`, using embeddings (Workers AI + Vectorize, or local embeddings computed by the desktop app). Embeddings are derived data, rebuildable, and not part of the vault.
  - **Write tools (careful):** `add_jot` writes directly (an agent's insight becomes a jot tagged `capturedBy: agent`). Anything that changes existing data (`file_items`, `create_note`, `tag_items`) becomes a **proposal in the Inbox** that you apply or dismiss. This is pond's review-before-apply rule.
  - **Prompts/resources:** canned analyses like “weekly review”, “what have I been circling lately”, “summarize this space”.

## 4. Difficulty, honestly

Measured 2026-10-24: ~15.6k lines of TS/TSX in `src/`; 45 of 57 `.tsx` files render DOM directly; ~8.7k lines of app CSS (plus 1.8k for `/mocks`); 25 files reference Supabase (~3.5k lines), 16 of them call it directly.

| Requirement | Difficulty | Why | What makes it easier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Journal-first UI (web) | **Medium** | Mostly recomposition, plus new entry cards, filing UI, inbox, composer syntax | Primitives, cards, journal data and Undo exist; v1 derives the feed from existing tables |
| Walk-away export (early) | **Small** | A script mapping today's tables to vault files, plus downloading images | Format is defined here; becomes the Phase 4 migration |
| Extension: YouTube + richer capture | **Small–medium** | Same interception pattern; pond has working YouTube hooks (`/youtubei/v1/like/like`) | Already goes through `memex-api` |
| Vault backend | **Hard** (the biggest) | Writer + journal, change feed, local replicas, auth, migration | One writer and one user remove most sync complexity; pond shows the files-as-truth pattern working |
| Desktop app shell + mirror | **Small** | Tauri around the existing web build; mirror = apply the change feed to a folder | Reuses web UI and the sync client |
| Desktop re-sync | **Medium, plus upkeep** | One harvester per site per list, a rate governor, sign-in handling. Sites change their internals, so expect occasional fixes | pond's harvesters and governor as reference (MIT); dedupe already exists server-side |
| React Native mobile | **Medium–hard** | Every screen is a rewrite; two UI codebases | Journal-first means ~4 screens; shared core; DOM components for the editor |
| Agent access (MCP) | **Small–medium** | Read tools are thin wrappers over the index; OAuth for claude.ai connectors is the fiddliest part; semantic search is extra | Files path is free; Cloudflare has remote-MCP + OAuth templates; review-before-apply reuses the Inbox |

Rough effort, biggest first: vault backend ≈ 2× mobile v1 ≈ 2× desktop re-sync (all three sites) ≈ 3× journal-first web ≈ 4× MCP v1 ≈ 4× YouTube capture.

## 5. Phases

Each phase ships something usable. Tracks marked **parallel** don't block the main line.

### Phase 0 — Plan ✓ 2026-10-24

### Phase 1 — Journal-first web, on today's stack
Validate the product direction before rebuilding the plumbing.
- [x] Round 5 `/mocks` with real data: Journal home (chat order, §8 #1), space board, Library table ✓ 2026-10-24 — picks in §8 #11–16
- [x] Feed derived from existing tables: jots (`self_messages`) interleaved with links/notes/tasks by `created_at`; auto-saves grouped (“3 pins saved on Pinterest”) using `links.source` ✓ 2026-10-25 (`src/utils/journalFeed.ts`, 11D entries in `components/journal/`)
- [x] Journal becomes `/`; current stream becomes `/library`; `/home` redirects ✓ 2026-10-25 (query carried, so the extension's `/home?link=` deep links still land)
- [x] Composer syntax: `@space`, URL → link, `[] ` → task, ⌘↵ → note ✓ 2026-10-25 (`src/utils/composer.ts`, `@` picker). `#tag` waits until tags come back (`SHOW_TAGS_UI` is off)
- [ ] Filing affordances on entries: space chips ✓, one-press suggestions ✓, “File to…” ✓ (2026-10-25); drag to sidebar space still to do
- [x] ~~Back-office rail~~ → decision 12B: Inbox in the sidebar and a header button, both only while suggestions wait; the tray opens beside the feed (`/?inbox=1`); Tasks in the sidebar (Library filtered to tasks for now) ✓ 2026-10-25
- [ ] Space page becomes a board (pinned sites · tasks · notes · saves) with a scoped Journal column
- [ ] Library: Table view and saved views (Unfiled, From X, From YouTube)
- [ ] Mobile web gets the same Journal-first layout (bridge until Phase 6)

### Phase 2 — The seam + walk-away export
- [ ] npm workspaces: `apps/web`, `packages/core`; `api/`, `scraper/`, `extension/` join the workspace
- [ ] Move types, `streamItems`, entry model, composer parsing, filters, source registry into core; Vitest for them (first tests in the repo)
- [ ] `Repository` interface (`entries`, `links`, `notes`, `tasks`, `spaces`, `tags`, `views`, `auth`); Supabase becomes one adapter
- [ ] Remove direct `supabase` imports from components into the auth adapter
- [ ] Design tokens exported as TS from core
- [ ] `docs/vault-format.md` v1 + fixture vault + a parser in core with a round-trip test
- [ ] **Export script** (`scripts/export-vault.mjs`): Supabase → vault folder, including downloaded images. Run it on demand or nightly. From here on, walk-away is real and agents can analyze the folder (§3.6 files path)

### Phase 3 — Capture: extension (parallel)
- [ ] Ops: deploy v0.2 for real (checklist in `docs/browser-extension-plan.md`)
- [ ] Data model: `source` (platform) + `sourceId` + `lists` + `capturedBy` instead of the single `links.source` string; dedupe on `(source, sourceId)`; keep the raw `capture` block
- [ ] YouTube: likes → link with thumbnail, channel, duration (port pond's hooks, keep MIT attribution)
- [ ] Already-saved badge (`GET /api/lookup`), post-capture space/tags in the popup, per-source and per-board default space
- [ ] Captures appear in the Journal as grouped auto-save entries (falls out of Phase 1)

### Phase 4 — Vault backend (leave Supabase)
- [ ] 4a Spike (time-boxed): custom outbox/change-feed on a Durable Object vs LiveStore, on web + Expo, with 5k fake items. Pick one
- [ ] 4b Writer: Durable Object applies changes in order, journals multi-file writes to R2, emits the change feed, maintains the SQLite/FTS index; “rebuild index from vault” command + CI test
- [ ] 4c `api/` grows into the backend; `/api/capture` keeps its contract so the extension doesn't change
- [ ] 4d Web client on a local replica (OPFS SQLite) + outbox, behind the core `Repository`
- [ ] 4e Auth: passkey sign-in + device pairing; tokens for desktop, phone, extension
- [ ] 4f Migration: the Phase 2 export → import into the vault; verify counts and a sample by eye; run both side by side for a week, then switch
- [ ] 4g Backups: R2 versioning or nightly snapshot; document restore and test it once
- [ ] 4h Retire Supabase: delete the adapter, the migrations folder becomes history, cancel the project

### Phase 5 — Desktop app (Tauri)
Re-sync only needs `/api/capture`, so 5b–5d can start after Phase 3, before the backend move. The mirror needs Phase 4.
- [ ] 5a Tauri shell around the web build; device pairing; tray + global jot shortcut; auto-update from GitHub Releases
- [ ] 5b Re-sync engine: scheduler, per-account scope, watermark + early stop, rate governor with persisted cooldowns, challenge detection, status line + history
- [ ] 5c Harvesters, one site at a time: X bookmarks → Pinterest saves (+ boards) → YouTube likes. Each: sign-in window, list walk, `Capture` mapping, fixtures
- [ ] 5d Collections → spaces mapping (Pinterest board → space)
- [ ] 5e Mirror `~/memex` from the change feed (after Phase 4); optional nightly git commit; later, folder watching for Obsidian edits

### Phase 6 — React Native app (Expo)
- [ ] App shell: Expo Router tabs (Journal · Library · Tasks), theme from core tokens, dark mode
- [ ] Journal feed + composer (keyboard-avoiding, chat-style list), entry cards per type
- [ ] Share extension (iOS) / share target (Android) → entry, optional space
- [ ] Library: spaces row + masonry grid; link detail; open in browser
- [ ] Note view/edit via a DOM component wrapping the web `MarkdownEditor`
- [ ] Offline + sync via core; TestFlight

### Phase 7 — Agents (MCP)
The files path works from Phase 2. The server path:
- [ ] 7a Remote MCP on the Worker with read tools (§3.6), bearer-token auth; test from Claude Code
- [ ] 7b OAuth so it works as a claude.ai / Claude Desktop custom connector (reuse passkey sign-in)
- [ ] 7c `get_images` returning thumbnails; canned prompts (weekly review, recent themes, space summary)
- [ ] 7d Write tools: `add_jot` direct; everything else lands as Inbox proposals you approve
- [ ] 7e Semantic search: embeddings (Workers AI + Vectorize, or local in the desktop app), `similar` / `clusters` / `themes`

### Later
Encryption at rest for the vault, two-way Obsidian edits, more sources (Are.na, Reddit, Instagram, Cosmos: pond has harvesters for each), new-tab page, opt-in AI filing suggestions powered by the same embeddings.

## 6. Guardrails for work done before each phase lands

- **New data access goes in a hook's `xxxApi` object, never in a component.** No new `supabase` imports in components.
- **Avoid Supabase-only features** (RPC functions, triggers that carry business logic, realtime channels). Each one is something to port.
- **New schema must map to the vault cleanly:** a stable id, plain fields, membership that could live on the item (`spaces: [...]`). If a feature stores something the user made or chose, it needs a home in §3.3, or it breaks the walk-away guarantee.
- **Logic that isn't UI goes in plain TS modules** (`src/utils`), free of React DOM, so it can move to `packages/core` unchanged.
- **The extension, desktop app and any new client talk to `memex-api`, never to Supabase.**
- **UI work on the stream should assume it becomes the Library**, and Journal work should assume it becomes home.
- **Use the words in `CONTEXT.md`** in code, copy and docs.

## 7. What stays true from VISION.md

The primitives (note, link, task), spaces as cross-cutting contexts, one tag vocabulary, two-second capture, markdown notes, single-user, the non-goals (no team features, no block editor, no project management), and the Pastel Sky design system.

## 8. Decisions

| # | Decision | Options | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Feed direction | Newest at bottom, composer below (chat) · newest at top (today's Journal) | **Newest at bottom, composer below** (2026-10-24) |
| 2 | Where the vault lives | R2 in your Cloudflare account + desktop mirror · synced folder only · git | **R2 + mirror** (2026-10-24) |
| 3 | Desktop app | Browser only · Tauri | **Tauri**, for re-sync, mirror and global shortcut (2026-10-24) |
| 4 | Sync engine | Custom outbox/change feed on the writer · LiveStore | Open, decided in the 4a spike. Leaning custom |
| 5 | Web platform | Keep Vite + React DOM · Expo web | Keep Vite |
| 6 | AI in filing | None · rules · opt-in AI | Rules first; AI later, on the MCP/embeddings work |
| 7 | Tasks tab on mobile | Own tab · saved view in Library | Leaning own tab |
| 8 | Images | Hotlink CDN URLs · download into the vault | **Download** (walk-away needs it) (2026-10-24) |
| 9 | Capture scope | Which lists per site, for the extension and re-sync | **X bookmarks, Pinterest saves, YouTube likes.** No X likes, no Watch later (2026-10-24) |
| 10 | MCP auth order | Token (Claude Code) first, OAuth (claude.ai) second · both at once | **Token first, OAuth second** (2026-10-24) |
| 11 | Journal entry style (round 5 mocks) | 11A rich · 11B quiet · 11C mixed · 11D tuned | **11D tuned**: picture galleries and bubbles for visual saves, compact rows for text-only things (2026-10-24) |
| 12 | Desktop layout | 12A right rail · 12B sidebar as tab bar · 12C no sidebar | **12B**: the sidebar is the desktop tab bar (Journal, Library, Inbox, Tasks, spaces); the Inbox tray appears only when something is waiting (2026-10-24) |
| 13 | Filing | 13A “File to…” menu · 13B inline suggestions · 13C triage | **13B** with five rules (2026-10-24): unfiled is a finished state (no empty chip, no warning); suggest only when likely right, always with its reason; the Inbox counts waiting suggestions, not every unfiled thing; “File to…” on every entry, and each use teaches the guesser; filing one save from a burst lights up its neighbours. Signals: same-site votes, saved within ~20 min of a filed save, similar title words; later Pinterest board → space mapping, X folders, embeddings. Measured on real data: about 2 in 3 filed links would have got a correct guess (website-only: 1 in 5). Tune with usage |
